Replicator supports copying kubernetes resources across namespaces. This controller was written keeping extensibility and [performance](./BENCHMARK.md) in mind. Therefore, it can be extended to any other resource as needed. The following resources are supported by the Kubernetes replicator.

* Secrets
* Config Maps
* Network Policies

## How to Use

### How to Setup Controller

#### Quickstart

Run the following command to apply the controller to your cluster. The `<VERSION>` should be replaced with the release version
to be used (eg:- `0.3.0`) and kubectl CLI should be configured pointing to the cluster in which the controller needs to be started.

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadundesilva/k8s-replicator/main/installers/install.sh | bash -s <VERSION>
```

#### Manual Installation

* Clone this repository and checkout the required version of K8s Replicator.
* Update the configuration (`<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/kustomize/config.yaml`) to match your needs.
* Apply the controller into your cluster by running the following command.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k kustomize
  ```

### How to mark a object to be replicated

Use the following label to mark the object to be replicated.

```properties
replicator.nadundesilva.github.io/object-type=source
```

All objects with the above label will replicated into all namespaces.

#### Ignored namespaces

The following namespaces are ignored by default.

* The namespace in which controller resides
* Namespaces with the name starting with `kube-` prefix
* Namespaces with the label
  ```properties
  replicator.nadundesilva.github.io/namespace-type=ignored
  ```

If you want to override this behavior and specifically replicate to a namespace, add the following label

```properties
replicator.nadundesilva.github.io/namespace-type=managed
```

### Examples

Examples based on the K8s Replicator can be found [here](./examples/).

### Additional labels/annotations used by the controller

The folloing labels are used by the controller to track the replication of resources.

* The following label with the value `replica` is used to mark the replicated objects.
  ```properties
  replicator.nadundesilva.github.io/object-type=replica
  ```
* The following annotation is used to store a replicated resource's source namespace.
  ```properties
  replicator.nadundesilva.github.io/source-namespace=<namespace>
  ```
* The following annotation is used to store a replicated resource's source resource version.
  ```properties
  replicator.nadundesilva.github.io/source-resource-version=<resource-version>
  ```

### How to Cleanup Controller

#### Quick Remove

Run the following command to remove the controller from your cluster. Kubectl CLI should be configured pointing to the cluster in which the controller needs to be started.

**Note:** This approach would only work if you used the Quickstart option for setting up the controller.

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadundesilva/k8s-replicator/main/installers/uninstall.sh | bash -s
```

#### Manual Removal

* Clone this repository and checkout the installed version of K8s Replicator.
* Remove the controller from your cluster by running the following command.

  ```bash
  kubectl delete -k kustomize
  ```
