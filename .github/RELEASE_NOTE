#### How to use

Check the [Read Me](https://github.com/nadundesilva/k8s-replicator/tree/{{VERSION_TAG}}#how-to-use) for instructions on how to use the Operator.

#### Changelog:

- Migrate to the Operator Framework
  - Improvements to reconciliation
  - Improvements to test cases
  - Remove the usage of source object version annotation from replicas, since the Operator framework properly reduces the overhead on the API Server and retries.

- Rename source object label value from `source` to `replicated`.

- Add support to record kubernetes events against the source object.
